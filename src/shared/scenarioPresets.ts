 * Example prompts surfaced in the PromptToScenarioModal (F.15).
 * The user can click any of these to open the modal pre-filled
 * with the corresponding prompt text.
 *
 * Each prompt is hand-tuned to ask the model for ~3-5 cards across
 * all three columns (subject / exposure / intervention) with realistic
 * evidence-based values. The model's output is unpredictable for very
 * long prompts; these stay short enough to be a single coherent
 * scenario.

 * Split: 3 community + 2 hospital.
